# Aerofit_Descriptive_Statistics_and_Probability_Project

## Project Overview:

This project analyzes customer data for Aerofit, a leading brand in fitness equipment. The primary goal is to understand the characteristics of customers who purchase different models of Aerofit treadmills. By creating detailed customer profiles for each product, we can provide better recommendations to new customers and tailor marketing strategies to specific target audiences.

## Dataset:

The analysis is based on the aerofit_treadmill.csv dataset, which contains information about 180 customers. The data includes the following attributes:

#### Product: The model of the treadmill purchased (KP281, KP481, KP781)

#### Age: Customer's age in years

#### Gender: Customer's gender

#### Education: Customer's education level in years

#### MaritalStatus: Customer's marital status

#### Usage: Average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill per week

#### Fitness: Self-rated fitness level on a scale of 1 to 5

#### Income: Customer's annual income

#### Miles: Average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week

## Analysis and Insights:

The project involves a deep dive into descriptive statistics and probability to uncover patterns in the customer data. Key analyses performed include:

#### Customer Profiling: 

Creating distinct profiles for each treadmill model based on demographic and fitness-related characteristics.

#### Contingency Tables: 

Using two-way contingency tables to explore the relationships between different customer attributes and the product purchased.

#### Probability Analysis: Calculating marginal and conditional probabilities to understand the likelihood of a customer with certain characteristics purchasing a specific treadmill model.

## Key Findings:

#### KP281 (Entry-Level): 

This model is popular among younger customers with lower incomes. They tend to have a moderate fitness level and plan to use the treadmill a few times a week.

#### KP481 (Mid-Level): 

Customers for this model are similar to those for the KP281 but may have slightly higher income and fitness levels.

#### KP781 (Advanced): 

This premium model is favored by customers with higher incomes and education levels. They are typically more serious about fitness, rating themselves higher on the fitness scale and planning to run more miles per week. There is a strong preference for this model among male customers.

## Business Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, several recommendations were formulated to help Aerofit improve its marketing and sales strategies:

#### Targeted Marketing: 

Develop marketing campaigns that are tailored to the specific customer profiles for each treadmill model.

#### Promote Premium Models: 

Focus on promoting the KP781 model to customers with higher incomes and a strong commitment to fitness.

#### Address Gender Gap: 

Create initiatives, such as special offers or trials, to increase the sales of the KP781 model among female customers.

#### Customer Engagement: 

Implement a reward program to encourage consistent usage and foster customer loyalty, potentially leading to future upgrades.
